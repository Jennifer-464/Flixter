### Notes
Challenges encountered while building the app:
There was initial confusion between the Main storyboard and the Launchscreen storyboard.
A big problem that I had was re-identifying the Movie Cell. I kept referencing the outlets and double, triple checking that I spelled everything correctly.
I did end up finding how to solve at the end. I forgot to click on 'Inherit Module From Target' as the video automatically just filled it in.
Another challenge was not being able to download CocoaPods which I solved by updating my mac to the most recent version.
From there on there were warnings, but was still able to run everything just fine.
